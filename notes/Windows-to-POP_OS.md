# Switching from Windows 11 to Pop!_OS

Edit: I realized that this was a list of what I did and didn't do. I found it boring, uninteresting, and unhelpful to anyone who may or may not want to follow the same switch in the future. I have removed this section since it provided very little value, and I will document everything I did do from here on forth in great detail as to be helpful, rather than just some sort of blog post.

## How I made POP_OS! My new daily driver
- Installed Steam via an `apt` install. [Notes Here](/notes/expanded/Steam_Install_Explained.md)
- Deleted the login with password prompt via `seahorse`
- How to set a wallpaper for multiple monitors since I can't get Wallpaper Engine on Steam to work [Notes to come soon]

## What I Learned
- Linux has a unique naming scheme for devices unlike Windows. Linux names storage devices are based on the actual hardware device type, how many of them are present, and how many times they are partitioned. I use NVME, so my storage shows up as nvme0n1p1. My fullwriteup about nvme naming can be seen in this [Deeper Breakdown](/notes/expanded/NVME_naming_explained_linux.md)
