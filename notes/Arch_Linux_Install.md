NOTE: This documentation assumes you've already downloaded the ISO â€” whether by torrent or direct HTML. (If not, you can grab it from the official Arch Linux website.)

I will be writing a guide on how to install a torrent downloader, and the differences between HTML downloads and torrent downloads in the future.
