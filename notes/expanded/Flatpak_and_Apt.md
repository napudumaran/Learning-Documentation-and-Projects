The tool `apt` is called a system-level package manager. That’s just technical speak for saying that the software is installed directly into your operating system, not just your user account. This means the program can interact with your computer’s files, access shared system resources, and is available to all users on the system. 

For example, if I install Google Chrome using APT, it’s not just for me—any user who logs into the computer can also use it. Chrome will also install any extra system files it needs to run properly (called dependencies), and it will be able to access files across the system just like any other trusted application.

`apt` is also the default package manager (installation tool). Updates and patches on most Linux operating systems depend on the `apt` tool.
