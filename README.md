# Napu Dumaran - Cybersecurity Projects & Learning Journey

Welcome. I’m a 26-year-old cybersecurity student, PC technician, and father working my way toward technical mastery.

Currently rebuilding my technical foundation from the ground up using Arch Linux, virtual machines, and real-world tools.

## 🛠️ Active Projects

### 🐧 Arch Linux Manual Install (VM - Virt-Manager)
Learning how to install and configure Arch Linux from scratch.

- Learned basic disk partitioning (`cfdisk`, `mkfs`, `mount`)
- Networking verified via DHCP
- Disk identified as `vda` using `lsblk`
- Next step: system install + bootloader config

[Notes coming soon]
