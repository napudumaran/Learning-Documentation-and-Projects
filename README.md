# Napu Dumaran â€“ Cybersecurity Projects & Learning Journey

Welcome. Iâ€™m a cybersecurity student, PC technician, and father. I am making the transition to Linux to relearn computers away from a Windows environment, and eventually create my own version of Kali as proof of intermediate level growth.

## Why build my own Kali? 
- I'll be able to know what every tool does and explain why I chose them and how I use them
- It won't be bloated
- I'll keep my version as minimal as possible
- I'll be able to learn by building, not just using
