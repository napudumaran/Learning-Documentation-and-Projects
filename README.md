# Napu Dumaran â€“ Cybersecurity Projects & Learning Journey

Welcome. Iâ€™m a cybersecurity student, PC technician, and father documenting my transition from Windows to Linux. My long-term goal is to build a custom, minimal version of Kali Linux as proof of intermediate-level mastery â€” with every decision explained and documented.

## Why build my own Kali? 
- I'll be able to know what every tool does and explain why I chose them and how I use them
- It won't be bloated
- I'll keep my version as minimal as possible
- I'll be able to learn by building, not just using
